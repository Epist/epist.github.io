    <div><p>larry grew up building physical things and expanded into the craft of systems and understanding. He studied computer science, cognitive science, philosophy, and literature during his undergraduate at Case Western and packaged this work into a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in embodied intelligence and some other majors and minors. He pursued his PhD in cognitive science at the University of California San Diego, where he studied communication, information, machine learning, and the philosophy, mathematics, and implementation of intelligence. He then went to develop recommendation algorithms at Snap, create matching systems as head of AI at a recruiting startup, design truth coherence algorithms at Niantic, and lead the machine learning team at Lunchclub. He currently works on Responsible AI at Google DeepMind and lives in the great city of Berkeley, where he is continuing his philosophical, theoretical, and technological work amongst friends.</p>
<p>on the border of society under the shadow of the redwoods, where he is growing a community of healers and friends and weaving a web of wisdom and understanding to help us to see, feel, and balance our connections with each other and the Earth.</p>
