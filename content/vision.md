+++

I believe that we can bring the world into balance by learning to care more deeply for all of the parts that compose our world and that a crucial part of this care will be expressed through technology. Care is crafted from understanding, respect, and will, and once care is deep enough and in a generative reciprocal relationship, it gives rise to self-expanding love. My work focuses on the development of a holistic sociotechnical tree with roots of philosophical orientation, a trunk of theoretical structure, and technological leaves and fruit that offer nourishment and support to all parts of our world.

I believe that we can grow love through technologies of togetherness that help us to understand, respect, and care for each other, and I am doing my best to support the responsible development of such technologies so that we can move though these trying times towards a world where we are all well together.
